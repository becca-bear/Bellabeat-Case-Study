They have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market, but to do so, they need to unlock new growth opportunities. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help the company achieve this goal. As a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team, I was asked to focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart device data to gain insights into how consumers are using their smart devices. My findings will help guide marketing strategy for the company.

# Prepare

### Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit

 * A total of 30 users consented to the submission of personal tracker data.
* The data set was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk. 
Link: https://zenodo.org/record/53894#.ZCr07-zMJ-W
* The data is not comprehensive as it lacks additional information, such as age, gender, ethnicity which could improve the accuracy of any analysis.
* The data is not current as it was obtained seven years ago.
* The data has been cited.




This analysis will be conducted using R Studio, which offers a wide range of packages and data visualization tools for effectively exploring the data.





# Process



To begin, I will import the files into R Studio and create data frames with concise names:


```
daily_activity <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
weight_info <- read_csv("weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
daily_sleep <- read_csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
daily_calories <- read.csv("dailyCalories_merged.csv")
heart_rate_sec <- read.csv("heartrate_seconds_merged.csv")
minute_METs <- read.csv("minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv")
daily_intensities <- read.csv("dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
daily_steps <- read.csv("dailySteps_merged.csv")
```

 
 
I need to make sure that all data was imported accurately, which can be by using the head() and glimpse() functions.

```
head(daily_activity)
```

```
glimpse(daily_activity)
```

Next, I will check the number of participants in each data sets by using the ```n_distinct()``` function.

```
n_distinct(daily_activity$Id)
n_distinct(daily_calories$Id)
n_distinct(daily_intensities$Id)
n_distinct(daily_sleep$Id)
n_distinct(weight_info$Id)
```


I find that there are 33 participants in the daily_activity, daily_calories and daily_intensities data sets, 24 in the daily_sleep and only 8 in the weight_info data set.
