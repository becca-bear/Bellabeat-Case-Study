# Scenario

Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. They have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market, but to do so, they need to unlock new growth opportunities. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help the company achieve this goal. As a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team, I was asked to focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart device data to gain insights into how consumers are using their smart devices. My findings will help guide marketing strategy for the company.
